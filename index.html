            <h1>Working Title</h1>

            <div>
                <p>"To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced." Straightway he began taking out the screws, and
                    finally lifted off the lid, showing the casing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for
                    me. It seemed to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have stripped off her
                    clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually took hold of his hand to stop him. He only said:
                    "You shall see," and again fumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw. Striking the turnscrew
                    through the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he made a small hole, which was,
                    however, big enough to admit the point of the saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old
                    corpse. We doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to such things, and
                    I drew back towards the door. But the Professor never stopped for a moment; he sawed down a couple
                    of feet along one side of the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. Taking the edge
                    of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the coffin, and holding up the candle into
                    the aperture, motioned to me to look.</p>

                <p>I drew near and looked. The coffin was empty.</p>

                <p>It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but Van Helsing was unmoved. He
                    was now more sure than ever of his ground, and so emboldened to proceed in his task. "Are you
                    satisfied now, friend John?" he asked.</p>

                <p>I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as I answered him:--</p>

                <p>"I am satisfied that Lucy's body is not in that coffin; but that only proves one thing."</p>

                <p>"And what is that, friend John?"</p>

                <p>"That it is not there."</p>

                <p>"That is good logic," he said, "so far as it goes. But how do you--how can you--account for it not
                    being there?"</p>

                <p>"Perhaps a body-snatcher," I suggested. "Some of the undertaker's people may have stolen it." I felt
                    that I was speaking folly, and yet it was the only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor
                    sighed. "Ah well!" he said, "we must have more proof. Come with me."</p>

                <p>He put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed them in the bag, blew out the
                    light, and placed the candle also in the bag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed
                    the door and locked it. He handed me the key, saying: "Will you keep it? You had better be assured."
                    I laughed--it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am bound to say--as I motioned him to keep it. "A key
                    is nothing," I said; "there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock of that
                    kind." He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then he told me to watch at one side of the
                    churchyard whilst he would watch at the other. I took up my place behind a yew-tree, and I saw his
                    dark figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my sight.</p>

                <p>It was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant clock strike twelve, and in
                    time came one and two. I was chilled and unnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on
                    such an errand and with myself for coming. I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly observant, and
                    not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether I had a dreary, miserable time.</p>
