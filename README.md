### This whole project is made to describe certain things about me and who I am. This projected that was created was intented to be the progress of my knowlegde when it comes to Web Dev. In the beggining of this site I only knew extremely basic information about web dev such as creating a h1 tag or simlpy adding text to a blank page. However as my class has progressed ive learned new information that has allowed me to expand my site and add more accesabilities for the user. Ive grown to learn things like image hover effetcs (which is seen on my profile picture in my hero), navbars, importing videos and much more. 

### I Chose the color scheme of the webiste  because it has the orangeish-blue contracst that I like and I find the colors pretty cool. The Text code is 05B0FE and the Background color code is F2D2BD
